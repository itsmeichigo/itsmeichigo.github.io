Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Huong Do, a.k.a ichigo (yes, lowercased) for simpler pronunciation.
I work fulltime as an iOS developer and spend my free time casually drinking tea, reading fictions and nibbling on little coding puzzles.

Learning is an ongoing process, and this blog is here to help me keep track of knowledge obtained. It's fun to stay curious and share my findings with the community ðŸ¤“

I realized that the &lt;code&gt;atool&lt;/code&gt; used for notarizing mac apps has long been discontinued and it was time to switch to &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/notarizing_macos_software_before_distribution"&gt;&lt;code&gt;notarytool&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It took me a while to read through Apple documentations and WWDC videos again to finally be able to distribute a working DMG for the new version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had some free time due to the Lunar new year holiday, so this was an opportunity to learn something new. It&amp;rsquo;s time to automate the distribution process for my mac apps, and a CLI tool is a perfect solution for this.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>

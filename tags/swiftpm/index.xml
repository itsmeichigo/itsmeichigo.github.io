I realized that the &lt;code>atool&lt;/code> used for notarizing mac apps has long been discontinued and it was time to switch to &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/notarizing_macos_software_before_distribution">&lt;code>notarytool&lt;/code>&lt;/a>. It took me a while to read through Apple documentations and WWDC videos again to finally be able to distribute a working DMG for the new version.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I had some free time due to the Lunar new year holiday, so this was an opportunity to learn something new. It&amp;rsquo;s time to automate the distribution process for my mac apps, and a CLI tool is a perfect solution for this.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>

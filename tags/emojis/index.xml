The tutorials were really fun and got me excited with using SwiftUI. I then continued with Paul Hudson&amp;rsquo;s series &lt;a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui">100 Days of SwiftUI&lt;/a>. Around the end of series, I could not hesitate any longer so I started a new Xcode project and build one of the things I like most about Slack app: the emoji picker!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The point of the &lt;a href="https://github.com/itsmeichigo/HappyPanel">Happy Panel project&lt;/a> was to learn SwiftUI and make use of its declarative syntax to build a complicated control with gestures and animations in a few lines of code. Because the biggest motivation for me to learn something new is to be able to make something beautiful and performant.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>

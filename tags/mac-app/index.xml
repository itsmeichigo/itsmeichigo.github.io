I realized that the &lt;code>atool&lt;/code> used for notarizing mac apps has long been discontinued and it was time to switch to &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/notarizing_macos_software_before_distribution">&lt;code>notarytool&lt;/code>&lt;/a>. It took me a while to read through Apple documentations and WWDC videos again to finally be able to distribute a working DMG for the new version.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I had some free time due to the Lunar new year holiday, so this was an opportunity to learn something new. It&amp;rsquo;s time to automate the distribution process for my mac apps, and a CLI tool is a perfect solution for this.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Releasing Jot It Down üóíÔ∏è</title><link>/posts/jot-it-down/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jan 2023 10:00:02 +0701</pubDate><guid>/posts/jot-it-down/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="/posts/jot-it-down/Icon-1024.png" alt="Jot It Down">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My new app &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/jot-it-down-minimal-note-app/id1668513911">Jot It Down&lt;/a> has been released on the Mac App Store!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Jot It Down is a simple app to quickly note down ideas or checklists.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Highlights:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>No formatting - focus on your contents only.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Markdown content is highlighted automatically.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Window always stays on top.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Can copy checklist with Markdown format to save somewhere else.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>All notes are auto saved.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Visit all past notes in the note list.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Fully private: the app has no access to the Internet.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Export files to your folders.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>This was a small project created during my one week Lunar new year holiday. I always wanted a simple and accessible note app to jot down any quick thoughts and discard them later, and this app serves that purpose. Among thousands of note apps out there, hopefully Jot It Down is helpful for you too.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Releasing Peachy üçë</title><link>/posts/peachy/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Mar 2022 10:00:02 +0701</pubDate><guid>/posts/peachy/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="/posts/peachy/demo.gif" alt="Peachy Demo">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m happy to announce that &lt;a href="https://itsmeichigo.io/peachy/">Peachy&lt;/a> is finally out in the wild! üéâ&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Peachy is a Mac app for entering Kaomojis easily. This was inspired by &lt;a href="https://matthewpalmer.net/rocket/">Rocket&lt;/a> and suggested/encouraged/challenged by a friend. I took this as an opportunity to get my feet wet with Mac app development, and it was a wholesome experience with a lot of challenges:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Integration of SwiftUI and AppKit. SwiftUI is nice for creating simple views, but for complex customizations, AppKit is the solution. It was painful, but I did learn a lot.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Integration of the Accessibility API and learning AppleScript.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A lot of workarounds!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Since Accessibility API doesn&amp;rsquo;t work with Sandbox, the app cannot be shipped in the App Store. This came with another bunch of challenges:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Creating and notarizing the DMG for the app.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Hosting the app manually.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Building a landing page to introduce the app.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Managing app versions with &lt;a href="https://sparkle-project.org">Sparkle&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>More excitingly, Peachy is FREE and &lt;a href="https://github.com/itsmeichigo/peachy">opensource&lt;/a>! If you like Peachy, please feel free to &lt;a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/itsmeichigo">buy me a cocktail&lt;/a>. Cheers! üç∏&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>

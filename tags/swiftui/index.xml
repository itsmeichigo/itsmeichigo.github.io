The idea was to create a view model for a SwiftUI view using some injected parameter and keep the view model as a @StateObject so that the its state is persisted when the view is redrawn.

The point of the Happy Panel project was to learn SwiftUI and make use of its declarative syntax to build a complicated control with gestures and animations in a few lines of code.</description></item></channel></rss>

&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m happy to announce that &lt;a href="https://itsmeichigo.io/peachy/">Peachy&lt;/a> is finally out in the wild! üéâ&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Peachy is a Mac app for entering Kaomojis easily. This was inspired by &lt;a href="https://matthewpalmer.net/rocket/">Rocket&lt;/a> and suggested/encouraged/challenged by a friend. I took this as an opportunity to get my feet wet with Mac app development, and it was a wholesome experience with a lot of challenges:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Integration of SwiftUI and AppKit. SwiftUI is nice for creating simple views, but for complex customizations, AppKit is the solution. It was painful, but I did learn a lot.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Integration of the Accessibility API and learning AppleScript.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A lot of workarounds!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Since Accessibility API doesn&amp;rsquo;t work with Sandbox, the app cannot be shipped in the App Store. This came with another bunch of challenges:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Creating and notarizing the DMG for the app.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Hosting the app manually.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Building a landing page to introduce the app.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Managing app versions with &lt;a href="https://sparkle-project.org">Sparkle&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>More excitingly, Peachy is FREE and &lt;a href="https://github.com/itsmeichigo/peachy">opensource&lt;/a>! If you like Peachy, please feel free to &lt;a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/itsmeichigo">buy me a cocktail&lt;/a>. Cheers! üç∏&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>

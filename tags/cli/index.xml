I realized that the atool used for notarizing mac apps has long been discontinued and it was time to switch to notarytool. It took me a while to read through Apple documentations and WWDC videos again to finally be able to distribute a working DMG for the new version.
I had some free time due to the Lunar new year holiday, so this was an opportunity to learn something new.</description></item></channel></rss>

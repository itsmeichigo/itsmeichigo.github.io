I realized that the atool used for notarizing mac apps has long been discontinued and it was time to switch to notarytool. It took me a while to read through Apple documentations and WWDC videos again to finally be able to distribute a working DMG for the new version.
I had some free time due to the Lunar new year holiday, so this was an opportunity to learn something new.</description></item><item><title>Releasing Jot It Down üóíÔ∏è</title><link>/posts/jot-it-down/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jan 2023 10:00:02 +0701</pubDate><guid>/posts/jot-it-down/</guid><description>My new app Jot It Down has been released on the Mac App Store!

As you all may already know, one of the cool new things introduced in WWDC 2022 was Swift Charts, a framework to create charts with SwiftUI. To learn more about the Swift Charts&amp;rsquo; potential, let&amp;rsquo;s go on a thrilling adventure to replace the chart in WooCommerce iOS with this ‚ú®‚ú® shiny new framework ‚ú®‚ú®.

It‚Äôs very common to come across comments that async/await will soon replace Combine, due to its potential and friendliness.
TL;DR: The motivation of this post is to discover the power of AsyncSequence when used with Async Algorithms, to see if we can use it in place of Combine. To be more specific, I‚Äôm curious to see if we can use it with SwiftUI to handle form validation ‚Äì one of my favorite applications of Combine when working with SwiftUI.</description></item><item><title>Releasing Peachy üçë</title><link>/posts/peachy/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Mar 2022 10:00:02 +0701</pubDate><guid>/posts/peachy/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m happy to announce that Peachy is finally out in the wild! üéâ
Peachy is a Mac app for entering Kaomojis easily. This was inspired by Rocket and suggested/encouraged/challenged by a friend. I took this as an opportunity to get my feet wet with Mac app development, and it was a wholesome experience with a lot of challenges:
Integration of SwiftUI and AppKit. SwiftUI is nice for creating simple views, but for complex customizations, AppKit is the solution.</description></item><item><title>Working with observable objects in SwiftUI</title><link>/posts/swiftui-observable-objects/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Sep 2021 10:00:02 +0701</pubDate><guid>/posts/swiftui-observable-objects/</guid><description>Earlier this week I learned about @StateObject initializer when reviewing a pull request. The idea was to create a view model for a SwiftUI view using some injected parameter and keep the view model as a @StateObject so that the its state is persisted when the view is redrawn. The view creates the @StateObject like so:
class ItemViewModel: ObservableObject { @Published var itemName: String init(item: Item) { self.itemName = item.name } } struct ItemView: View { @StateObject private var viewModel: ItemViewModel init(item: Item) { _viewModel = StateObject(wrappedValue: ItemViewModel(item: item)) } var body: some View { TextField(&amp;#34;Item Name&amp;#34;, text: viewModel.</description></item><item><title>Breaking down large pull requests</title><link>/posts/breaking-down-pull-requests/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jul 2021 17:02:02 +0700</pubDate><guid>/posts/breaking-down-pull-requests/</guid><description>This post was originally posted in WooCommerce Mobile Project P2 page.

Usually we have several teams working on different features, and we break down tasks into bite-size ones ‚Äì so large PRs aren‚Äôt really a problem. However, for folks working alone on a backlog story, or joining the team for General Maintenance Rotation, and especially Trialmatticians ‚Äì it‚Äôs common to face the issue of handling a big task and having to break them down into smaller parts.</description></item><item><title>Releasing Fretboard üé∏</title><link>/posts/fretboard/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Jan 2021 10:00:02 +0701</pubDate><guid>/posts/fretboard/</guid><description>Fretboard is a weekend project to display guitar and ukulele chords using SwiftUI.

In WWDC 2019 Apple introduced their very own FRP framework, making it possible to utilize the paradigm natively with declarative Swift API. The two frameworks share quite a few similarities in terms of principles and usage, so it can be not too daunting to get your feet wet with Combine if you have already been using RxSwift in your projects.</description></item><item><title>Learning SwiftUI by Building a Slack-like Emoji Picker</title><link>/posts/swiftui-happy-panel/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Sep 2020 21:23:02 +0701</pubDate><guid>/posts/swiftui-happy-panel/</guid><description>I started learning SwiftUI around August 2020 first with Apple&amp;rsquo;s SwiftUI Tutorials. The tutorials were really fun and got me excited with using SwiftUI. I then continued with Paul Hudson&amp;rsquo;s series 100 Days of SwiftUI. Around the end of series, I could not hesitate any longer so I started a new Xcode project and build one of the things I like most about Slack app: the emoji picker!
The point of the Happy Panel project was to learn SwiftUI and make use of its declarative syntax to build a complicated control with gestures and animations in a few lines of code.</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/about/</guid><description>Hi there üëã
